This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This\r\n\t *    may be done in the worker thread.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\r\n\t *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\r\n\t *    to extract any synthetic events.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\r\n\t *    \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Overview of React and the event system:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * +------------+    .\r\n\t * |    DOM     |    .\r\n\t * +------------+    .\r\n\t *       |           .\r\n\t *       v           .\r\n\t * +------------+    .\r\n\t * | ReactEvent |    .\r\n\t * |  Listener  |    .\r\n\t * +------------+    .                         +-----------+\r\n\t *       |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\r\n\t *       |           .               |         |Plugin     |\r\n\t * +-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\r\n\t * |     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\r\n\t * |     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\r\n\t * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\r\n\t * | ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\r\n\t * |  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\r\n\t * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\r\n\t * |     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\r\n\t * |     |      |    .    +--------------+\r\n\t * +-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\r\n\t *       |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\r\n\t *       +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\r\n\t * +-------------+   .                         +-----------+\r\n\t * | application |   .\r\n\t * |-------------|   .\r\n\t * |             |   .\r\n\t * |             |   .\r\n\t * +-------------+   .\r\n\t *                   .\r\n\t *    React Core     .

The `Transaction` class itself will supply one additional\r\n\t * automatic invariant for you - the invariant that any transaction instance\r\n\t * should not be run while it is already being run. You would typically create a\r\n\t * single instance of a `Transaction` for reuse multiple times, that potentially\r\n\t * is used to wrap several different methods.
